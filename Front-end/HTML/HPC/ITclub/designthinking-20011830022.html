		In India, 41km of highway road was constructed every day for the year of 2016. In the Indian government budget, it estimated the cost just for 2016 to be 19 billion USD. It would be financing any shortfall through tax-free government bonds. Computational thinking would have played an instrumental role in deciding on where the road would go through with taking into account the key hubs and may have saved the government millions, if not billions of dollars. <br><br>

		Jeanette Wing (2012) defines computational thinking as the thought process involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solution in a way that a computer-human or machine can effectively carry out. It is the process of abstraction by; choosing the right abstractions, operating in terms of multiple layers of abstraction simulations and defining the relationships between layers guided by efficiency, correctness, and flexibility. Computational thinking can best be related to as writing software or instructionals. Every action or non-action is accounted for in the way computational artifacts are constructed. Computational thinking is great for working out a solution but there is an argument that computational thinking does not put enough emphasis on the problem itself. <br><br>

		Design thinking, on the other hand, attempts to understand the intent or problem before looking at any solution — computational or otherwise. Design thinking attempts to identify why the problem exists in the first place before solving it. IDEO defines design thinking as the application of empathy and experimentation to arrive at innovation solutions through making decisions based on stakeholder input and evidence based research. Using the Indian roading example, a design thinker would ask, what is the intent of building the roads in the first place? <br><br>

		Let’s suppose a thought experiment: you need to move 10 boxes from one side of town to the other. How would you do it? As a computational thinker, a set of instructions would be drafted, tested, and the most efficient route would be attained. Questions that would be asked by a computational thinker could include ‘what are the sizes of the boxes, how heavy are they, and is anything fragile’ to best cater for the most effective action. In design thinking, the primary question would be ‘why do you want to move the box in the first place?’. <br><br>

		I think the question ‘why do you want to move the box in the first place’ is the most important question. This frames the problem in a whole new light. An interesting finding could include that you specifically do not need to move the box yourself or that there is something inside the box that needs to be moved, and not the box itself. I think that design thinking shapes computational thinking and it is design thinking that needs to be given the highest priority in our education system. <br><br>

		When I look back to my own education, I did not necessarily understand why I was learning what I was. There was a constant struggle between my classmates and my maths teacher for why we need to know how imaginary numbers interact in squares. This argument was not isolated. It was in my biology class — why do we need to learn the Kreb’s cycle?, my chemistry class — why are the properties of carbon isotopes so important?, and my English class — why do we need to analyse metaphysical poetry written 500 years ago?. Six years on, the same debates continue in classes all around the world. <br><br>

		It is not my teacher’s fault. In fact, my teachers were very good. To add to that, my maths teacher said something that may not have seemed like much at the time but is pivotal to my argument now — ‘a calculator is only as smart as the user. If you do not understand the mechanics, you will not comprehend the answer, nor the way it got there.’ <br><br>

		I feel the same approach has been taken with much of education systems around the world. We have taken a computational approach to much of what is being taught in schools and those that do the best are those that follow it. Those that question why and lose interest are those that tend to be the brightest students, but also the ones that fail the system because of the disconnect between theoretical frameworks and practical applications of their learning. Oftentimes, teachers do not even understand why they are having to teach what they are. All they know is that those are the learning outcomes. But who sets the learning outcomes? And for what intent? <br><br>

		I believe a design thinking approach needs to be taken towards education. All learning outcomes need to have a practical application beyond the walls of a classroom. Furthermore, the learning needs to be accessible, meaningful and driven by curiosity. I believe there is greater value in working out a problem that is interesting to a student as opposed to one that is arbitrary to them. I don’t understand why students need to engage with 16th-century poetry when they are bubbling with ideas and often times struggle to competently express themselves. To see the disconnect, all you need to do is walk into a presentation at your local school or university. <br><br>

		Flipping the class to a complete student centric model may take another 20 years, but we need to start making little steps. An unintended consequence of our education system is the making of wicked problems. We will not be able to solve wicked problems with standardised learning where theory holds priority over experimentation, tinkering, and play. Students should be encouraged to ask why, and the answer should never be “because it will be in your exam”. <br><br>
